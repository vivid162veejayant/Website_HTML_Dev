        <h1>How HTML and CSS Work Together</h1>
        <p>
            HTML and CSS are designed to work as a team. HTML creates the <strong>structure and content</strong> 
            of a webpage. It defines headings, paragraphs, images, and links. On its own, HTML only shows information 
            in a simple, plain format.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS controls the <strong>appearance</strong> of that HTML content. It decides how elements look, including 
            colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            In simple terms: <br>
            <strong>HTML = What is on the page</strong> <br>
            <strong>CSS = How it looks</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A webpage becomes complete only when both are used together.</p>

        <h2>How CSS Styles HTML</h2>
        <p>
            CSS styles HTML by <strong>selecting HTML elements</strong> and applying visual rules to them.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS can change the color of all headings</li>
            <li>It can adjust spacing between sections</li>
            <li>It can center text or images</li>
            <li>It can add backgrounds and borders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            CSS does not create content. Instead, it targets existing HTML elements and changes how they are displayed in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            This separation keeps websites: <br>
            - Clean <br>
            - Organized <br>
            - Easy to update and maintain
        </p>

        <h2>Before Styling (HTML Only)</h2>
        <div class="section-box">
            <p>
                When a webpage uses only HTML: <br>
                - Text appears in default colors (usually black) <br>
                - Fonts are basic <br>
                - Content is left-aligned <br>
                - There is little spacing <br>
                - The page looks plain and unstyled
            </p>
            <p>Although the information is correct, the page may feel boring and difficult to read.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>After Styling (HTML + CSS)</h2>
        <div class="section-box">
            <p>
                When CSS is added: <br>
                - Headings stand out with different colors and sizes <br>
                - Text becomes easier to read with better fonts and spacing <br>
                - Sections are clearly separated <br>
                - Background colors improve visual comfort <br>
                - Links look interactive and noticeable
            </p>
            <p>
                The same HTML content becomes more attractive and user-friendly without changing the structure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Using HTML and CSS Together Is Important</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Build structured and meaningful content</li>
            <li>Control design without rewriting content</li>
            <li>Create consistent styling across multiple pages</li>
            <li>Improve user experience and readability</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
            HTML builds the page. CSS styles the page. Learning how they work together helps you move from simple web pages to professional-looking websites.
