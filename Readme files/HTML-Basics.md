## HTML Basics

### What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages. HTML tells the browser **what content exists** on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

HTML does **not** control colors or design. Its main job is to organize content.

### Why HTML Is Important

Every website on the internet uses HTML. Without HTML:

* Text would not appear properly
* Images would not load
* Links would not work
* Pages would have no structure

HTML is the **foundation of web development**.

### How HTML Works

HTML works by using **elements**.
An element usually has:

* A start
* Content
* An end

Each element tells the browser how to display that content.

### Common HTML Elements (Explained Simply)

**Headings**
Headings are used for titles and section names.
They help organize content and make pages easier to read.

**Paragraphs**
Paragraphs are used for normal text content such as explanations, stories, or descriptions.

**Links**
Links allow users to move from one page to another or open a different website.

**Images**
Images are used to display pictures on a webpage, such as photos, icons, or illustrations.

**Lists**
Lists help display items in an organized way, such as steps, features, or examples.

### Basic Structure of an HTML Page

Every HTML page follows a basic structure:

* One part stores information about the page
* Another part contains the visible content users see

This structure helps browsers understand and display the page correctly.
