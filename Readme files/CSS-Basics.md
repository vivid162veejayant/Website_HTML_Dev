CSS Basics



What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to control how HTML elements look on a webpage. CSS allows you to change colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and backgrounds to make your website visually appealing and user-friendly.

CSS works together with HTML. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS provides the style and design.








Colors, Fonts, and Backgrounds

CSS lets you style your web page in many ways:

Colors: You can change the color of text, backgrounds, borders, and other elements. Colors can be defined using HEX codes, RGB, HSL, or color names.

Fonts: You can choose different fonts, sizes, and styles for your text. Fonts make your page more readable and visually appealing.

Backgrounds: You can use solid colors, gradients, or images as the background for your page or sections.

These styling options help make your website attractive and easy to read.






External vs Internal CSS:

CSS can be applied to HTML in two main ways:

Internal CSS: Written inside a <style> tag in the HTML <head>. This method is good for small pages or testing purposes.

External CSS: Saved in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML page using a <link> tag. This is the preferred method for larger websites, as it allows you to reuse styles across multiple pages and keep your HTML clean.

Using external CSS makes your website organized, consistent, and easy to maintain.








Why CSS is Important?

CSS allows you to:

Make your website look professional

Control layout and spacing to improve readability

Highlight important sections or buttons

Provide visual feedback (like hover effects) for interactivity

Without CSS, web pages would look plain and unorganized, even if the HTML structure is correct.










CSS is Beginner-Friendly

CSS is easy to learn because:

It uses simple and descriptive words

You can see the results immediately in the browser

You can start small and gradually style more complex pages

Learning CSS after HTML lets you turn a simple webpage into a visually attractive and functional website.
